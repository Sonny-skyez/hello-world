# hello-world

Hi guys!

Here is some of my ideas / programs written in Python 3.7.

[war - card game](https://github.com/Sonny-skyez/hello-world/blob/master/war-card-game) - a simple card game witch everybody likes. it's one of my first programs written ever, so please don't be harsh, script could be better but it works!

[pascal triangle](https://github.com/Sonny-skyez/hello-world/blob/master/pascal-triangle.py) - simple but effective code, it's nice to see its printing results.
